tasks:
  prepare:
  # This task is in charge of transforming the input data into the format
  # expected by the model cubes.

      outputs: {output_path: results/}

  sanity_check:
  # This task ensures that the previously transformed data was transformed correctly.
  # It runs a set of tests that check que quality of the data. The rigurosity of those
  # tests is determined by the cube author.
      parameters:
        inputs: {data_path: data/, parameters_file: {type: file, default: parameters.yaml}}

  statistics:
  # This task computes statistics on the prepared dataset. Its purpose is to get a high-level
  # idea of what is contained inside the data, without providing any specifics of any single entry
